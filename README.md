# BCI

This simple project was created to demonstrate how BCI can be done from Data acquisition, Running the Experiment, and Analyzing the Data perspective.  Particularly, this is an ongoing project and I intend to populate this with at least four examples:

1. Psychological Experiment
2. SSVEP + control  (real-time)
3. P300 + speller  (real-time)
4. MI + control   (real-time)

All will be centered around the use of:

Hardware:
- OpenBCI + Cyton/Daisy, 250Hz

Software:
- Python-based

All code will be centered around 3 typical steps
1. Data acquisition
2. Experiment (stimuli)
3. Analysis

Analysis will include:
1. Basic feature extraction and classification
2. Common Spatial Pattern and classification
3. Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural network
4. Temporal Convolutional Network
5. Convolutional Network (squeezed time into image-like vectors)
